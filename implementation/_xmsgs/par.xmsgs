<msg type="info" file="Route" num="538" delta="new" >One or more MIG cores have been detected in your design and have been successfully
placed and routed. These MIG core(s) have critical skew and delay requirements 
that are independent of the user (UCF) timing constraints. These MIG-related timing 
constraints have been successfully met in this design. However, the user must verify
separately that all timing constraints specified in the UCF file have been met.

The following Clock signals have USELOWSKEWLINES constraint
